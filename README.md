# Simple_Parking_Meter_Machine

In this assessment I was asked to simulate a parking meter machine,  to create a function that would take in 2 parameters. Parameter 1 would be the amount you put in the machine and Parameter 2 would be the amount the machine would deduct for parking.

* The function should also return the leftover amount after deduction broken to denominations in Rand currency.


There is so many ways to tackle this function but I decided to keep simple and easy to understand and this is how I implemented my main function:

    * I created time options of which the user can select how long they had parked for , basically thats just like the user inserting the ticked they collected at the time of their arrival and that would determine how much they should pay to get their ticket for depature.

    * After they insert the amount into the machine , the change or leftover amount will be dispenced to the user with their ticket and a message will be displayed.

    * As for the currency i kept it simple even though there is so many ways to deal with that like the NumberFormat , printf and so many other ways. 

This function was done is Java as it is one of my favourite languages and definitely this function can be modified in so many ways to make it better.
